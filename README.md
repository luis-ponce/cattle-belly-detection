# cattle-belly-detection
Jupyter-Notebook


This project is an application of object detection using image segmentation implemented in YOLOV5.

Two scripts are modified to convert masks images into txt files with the labeling. 
Labeling can be carried out with label-studio, but the source images are not shared here.

YOLOV5 repository should be installed by running the second cell of the notebook.
